  "description": "Tanks is a turn based game where a player faces off against other players or computer players. They are allowed to move a certain distance and aim and make a shot each turn. Terrain is destroyed with the shots as well as damage to the player if the player gets hit. Destroyed terrain under a tank will cause the tank to fall. Changes in terrain also provide varying obstacles for movement and aiming.",
